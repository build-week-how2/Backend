- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
People who want to learn how to do something can use this app for instruction. Content creators have this platform to further expose their brand

- What is the mission statement?
Our mission is to make lifehacks accessible to everyone.

- What feedback have you gotten from potential users?
It would be useful

- Have you validated the problem and your solution with your target audience? How?
The problem has been validated by looking at existing solutions

Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
